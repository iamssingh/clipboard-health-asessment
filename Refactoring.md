# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

In this refactored code, I've broken down the main function into smaller, more focused functions to improve readability and maintainability. The deterministicPartitionKey function now has three parts:

It first checks if the event has a custom partition key using the getEventPartitionKey function, which improves readability by encapsulating this logic.
If no custom partition key is found, it generates a candidate key by hashing the event data using the generateCandidatePartitionKey function. The use of a separate function here helps in maintaining the single responsibility principle and makes the code easier to follow.
Finally, if the candidate key exceeds the maximum allowed length, the function generates a long partition key by hashing the candidate key again using the generateLongPartitionKey function.
Additionally, the variable declarations for TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY and MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH are kept at the top to make them easily configurable and improve code maintainability.

The unit tests cover all the different scenarios of generating the partition key, ensuring that the refactoring doesn't break the existing functionality. The tests are concise, well-structured, and provide a comprehensive coverage of the code logic, making it easier to validate the correctness of the refactored function.
