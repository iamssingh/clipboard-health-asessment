# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

Optimizations:

Removed unnecessary variables (TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY and MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH) to simplify the code and improve readability.
Removed the second check for the candidate variable to convert it to a string using JSON.stringify. Since we are already checking if the event's partitionKey is a string, we can directly return it.
In cases where event.partitionKey is not available, I directly calculate the candidate partition key using SHA3-512 and avoid an additional function call.
I skipped the intermediate variable assignment for candidate when it exceeds the maximum length and calculate the long partition key directly.
By making these optimizations, the code becomes more concise and avoids unnecessary calculations, making it slightly more optimized. The unit tests provided in the previous response would still provide good coverage for this optimized version as well.
